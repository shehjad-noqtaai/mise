Explain how a glossary entry that captures term, status, part of speech, gender, and usage context gives translation agents (human or AI) the information they need to make correct decisions.

Cover three specific ways metadata improves output: (1) glossaries ensure approved terminology and prevent mistranslation of brand/product names, (2) style guides enforce the right register and tone per locale, (3) content-aware filtering means only relevant glossary terms are injected into each prompt. Contrast the "paste text into ChatGPT" approach with a structured pipeline where glossaries, style guides, and locale rules are assembled into agent prompts at translation time.

Cover how rich text formats like Portable Text store content as structured data that can be rendered differently per channel. Discuss the organizational shift: content teams stop thinking in "pages" and start thinking in "content objects" that flow to wherever they're needed. Include examples of how a single product announcement can be rendered as a full blog post, a social media card, an email snippet, and an in-app notification, all from the same source document.
